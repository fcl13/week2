Some Guidelines for the projects
================================




Goal
----

The main intention behind these projects is to familiarize yourself
with Python by writing a useful piece of code that might help you in
your research - either by facilitating some annoying repetitive task,
or by computing something, or presenting results, etc...

We believe that this is the better way for you to learn Python, as it
can fit many different uses, and since you will have a personal
interest in coding this, you will be more motivated.



Examples of personnal projects that can be solved with Python
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Annoyed by loosing notes that you write here and there on a piece of
  paper ? You want a program to store this, were you can type
  mathematical formula, link to files on your local disk ? Write a
  python code that does just this ! (you might want to look-up at
  markup languages like Markdown (md), or RestructuredText (rst))
- Connecting over ssh to a remote server, launching some simulations,
  waiting for them to die, copy the log files here, look at the last
  line ? You can write a code that logs to the server, monitor the
  status of the log file, and send you an e-mail if it crashed, while
  downloading the faulty file to your laptop.
- Having a ton of long and boring output files, that take time to
  navigate ? Generate a webpage automatically that classify the
  experiment, order them by date, extracts only the meaningful bits from
  the output files
- Any data processing from large files, or file handling with complex
  naming conventions ? 
- Want to write a script to backup your data on an external ? With a
  graphical interface to not mess things up ?
- You have an existing code in C/Fortran that no one can read anymore
  because of the absence of commenting, that does not work anymore for
  some people ? Rewrite it in Python, comment it, maybe with the
  autodocumentation tool Sphinx.

Examples of other projects
--------------------------

With this being said, if it happens that you find no possible project
or ideas in the previous list, you might want to take a look at this:

- [writing AI](http://aspp.github.io/pelita/) is tempting you ? Give
  it a go and write an artificial intelligence for a pacman clone.
- [like gaming](http://www.pygame.org/) ? Write a snake clone, or
  pong, anything simple in 2D to learn the usefulness of OOP !
